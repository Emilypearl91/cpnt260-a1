 <h1>Throne of glass book review</h1>
  <h2>About Throne of Glass</h2>
  <p>Throne of glass is a young adult novel by <strong>Sarah j. Maas</strong> about a young adult named Celaena Sardothien who is a highly skilled assassin. Throne of glass is the first book in the  <em>Throne of glass series</em>. This book is set in a olden day style fantasy magical world. We start off the book with Celaena in a slave encampment being offered a chance at freedom if she competes to become the king of Adarlan’s assassin and after she works for him for four years. We follow her journey as she competes in the competition and tries to solve a series of murders.</p>
<h2>Thoughts on the book</h2>
<p>This book is for anyone who likes to read female main character fantasy novels and multiple plot twists. While I really enjoyed the book I didn’t agree with how the main character bashes another because she is trying to fit in in society, while also trying to do the same. I think it is still a good novel and series to read as there is a really big theme of mental health and working through trauma. Another really strong them is chosen family and fighting for what you believe in. </p>
